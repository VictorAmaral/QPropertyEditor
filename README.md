QPropertyEditor v0.4
===============

This small library is used to be a lightweight method to allow the graphical editing of properties defined via the Q_PROPERTY macro. It can be easily extended for custom datatypes. 

This library was first published in [http://qt-apps.org/](http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/QPropertyEditor?content=68684). The latest edition version of this library is `v0.3` which is published in Sep 28 2008. However, the `v0.3` version is **Only** fit for Qt4.

Since it hasn't been updated for a long time, I decided to move it to Github, and make it support Qt5. 

QPropertyEditor is tested successfully in these platform as follow:

- Qt4.8.5 64bit MSVC10.0 Windows
- Qt5.3.0 64bit MSVC12.0 Windows
- Qt5.3.0 32bit MSVC12.0 Windows
- Qt5.3.0 32bit MinGW4.8.2 Windows
